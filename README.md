This website contains lots of information on EU made for educational purposes. It was build and written for a contest for the best educational material about EU – and [won the contest together with four other](http://www.eu-oplysningen.dk/emner/prisopgave/).

*This was my first website and what really made me become a developer eventually. It's here now to persist – because content shouldn't be removed.*
